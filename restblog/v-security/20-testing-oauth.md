# Testing with OAuth 2.0

Now that we have the core security pieces in place, 
we will need to take a look at:


- The process of creating an `Access Token` / `Refresh Token`


- What the token looks like after it is decrypted.


- How is that token stored with the client.


- How to send it back to the server when making a request.

---

### Of Note: From this point forward, we will use the Client-Side App or Fetch API within the browser console for much of the testing.

## TODO: Create the Access and Refresh Tokens

In order to authenticate a `User` with our server, the `User` must actually exist and be given a role.

1. After starting your application, navigate to `/login` in the browser.


2. Login with an existing user.


3. Open `Inspect -> Application -> Storage - Local Storage -> http://localhost:8080 `


4. If your auth request was successful, you will see two tokens:

![tokens](../tokens.png)

5. Copy the `access_token` value and navigate to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
    - Scroll down paste your token in the `Encoded` box:
    
![jwt.io decoder](../decode.png)

6. Looking at the decoded JWT (JSON Web Token), what do you notice?
    - Compare these values to what you see in `OAuthConfiguration`

## TODO: Test Your Endpoints

Now, it's time to ensure your user has access to the endpoints they need.

**More importantly**, let's verify that unauthenticated users can't access secured endpoints as well as seeing that users without proper authorization can't perform *unauthorized* operations:

- [x] Unauthenticated user cannot edit posts
- [x] Unauthenticated user cannot delete posts

NOTE: To test authenticated access to endpoints in Postman, add a Header to your request with a key of `Authorization` and a value of `Bearer <your access_token>`

- [x] Authenticated user with USER role can **view** all posts
- [x] Authenticated user with USER role can **create** posts
- [x] Authenticated user with USER role can **edit their** posts
- [x] Authenticated user with USER role can **delete their** posts


- [x] Authenticated **ADMIN** user can perform any operation on any posts
