# Project Setup

Throughout the course of this module, we will be building a blogging application.

Building this application will allow you to learn how Spring handles basic CRUD operations, as well as user authentication. In addition, you can use your blog as a personal site to show off your Java and JavaScript chops!

# NOTE: IF YOU BARE-CLONED THIS PROJECT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THE BELOW SETUP

## IntelliJ Setup

IntelliJ has built-in integration with the [Spring Initializr][1], which we will be using to bootstrap our application.

[1]: http://start.spring.io/

1. Create a new Project in IntelliJ

1. For the project type, select "Spring Initializr"

    - Choose the Java version appropriate for your cohort for the Project SDK

1. Project Metadata

    - Make sure "Maven Project" is selected (it should be by default).
    - For the group and package name enter `com.codeup`.
    - For the "Artifact" and "Name" fields enter a name for your project without spaces.
    - Choose the Java version appropriate for your cohort under the Packaging field
    - Enter a brief description of your project in the "Description" field.

1. Next we will be prompted for the dependencies of our project.

   For the "Spring Boot" dropdown, select version 2.1.x

   Here we will select any dependencies that our project will have. This is just a shortcut for adding [spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters#starters)
   `<dependency>` elements to our `pom.xml`. If you know what pieces of the Spring framework you are going to use, you would select them here.

   For now, just check "Web" -> "Web".

1. Now we will be prompted for a project name and location. Choose whatever name you prefer (this is just how we will refer to the project on your computer).

1. Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file

        src/main/resources/application.properties

1. Create an empty file at `src/main/resources/example.properties` and add it to Git. We'll use this file to communicate to other developers what settings are needed to run this application, without sharing our passwords or API keys in GitHub.

1. Create a new repository locally and on GitHub for this project.

1. Link the remote repository's SSH address to your local with `git remote add origin [your address]`.

1. Let's code!
