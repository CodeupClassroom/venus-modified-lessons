# Blog App Features

Features are things about the software that will make people want to use it. Often, features tend to be broad groupings of functionality. Sometimes, they can be characteristics that are not specifically functional in nature, e.g., "mobile-friendly".

The following features will be implemented in our blog app during the course of this module:

### F1: work with blog posts, i.e., blog SCRUD ("S" is for Search)

### F2: restrict access to blog post functionality

### F3: categorize blog posts

---

Features themselves are a little too broad to tackle as a developer. Features are like categories of functionality. Developers like to get things done efficiently, and mentally or literally put a check by a task that says "Done!". Therefore, we break features into user stories. A user story (US) should be small enough for a single dev to finish in no more than a day or 2. Sometimes, a US may be too large and should be further decomposed into tasks. For example, a CRUD feature can easily break into at least 4 distinct and independently workable user stories (one for each piece of CRUD functionality). 

Note that we map User Stories back to Features because often customers want an entire feature to be built first.

User stories also follow a particular format. See https://java.codeup.com/capstone/workbook/ for information regarding the structure of a user story.

The user stories for the rest blog are:

### US1: As a user, I can view any posts. (maps to F1)

### US2: As a User, I can create posts. (maps to F1)

### US3: As a User, I can edit posts. (maps to F1)

### US4: As a User, I can delete posts. (maps to F1)

### US5: As a user, I can register with the application. (maps to F2)

### US6: As a user, I can view, edit, and delete information about myself. (maps to F2)

### US7: As a user, I can see the author of blog posts. (maps to F1)

### US8: As a user, I can see my authored blog posts. (maps to F1)

### US9: As a user, I can view categories assigned to a post. (maps to F3)

### US10: As a user, I can assign categories to a post. (maps to F3)

### [OPTIONAL] US11: As a user, I can search for posts by category. (maps to F1)

### US12: Creation of and changes to posts will be stored. (maps to F1)

### US13: As a user, I can receive an email when new posts are created. (maps to F1)

### US14: As a validated user, I can create, edit and delete posts. (maps to F2)

### US15: As an anonymous user, I can neither create, edit, nor delete posts. (maps to F2)

### US16: As an ADMIN user, I have full access to create, edit, and delete any posts. (maps to F2)
