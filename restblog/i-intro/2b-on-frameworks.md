# On Frameworks

Before we can begin using the **Spring Framework**, we should step back and ask: 

### What *is* a framework?

In software development, a **framework** is a general term. However, many developers expect a framework to:
1. provide a collection of tools, e.g., a library of functions and/or objects
2. prescribe a specific way to use those tools

### Is a framework a library?

No. Frameworks tend to be larger and more complex than a single library, frequently including multiple libraries. 

Libraries tend to make some part of building a software application easier/faster, like sending email. Frameworks, on the other hand, tend to make the job of building an entire software application easier/faster. But, in order to gain the most benefit from a framework, you must build your software the specific way the framework requires. 

In a nutshell, frameworks tend to solve bigger problems than a single library, but they also tend to have steeper learning curves and dictate the overall way your program must be structured.
