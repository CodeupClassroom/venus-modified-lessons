# Replacing jQuery with vanilla JavaScript

[What is jQuery?](https://java.codeup.com/jquery/)

jQuery is handy to do the following:

- navigate a document
- select DOM elements
- handle events
- do more with fetch

But you don't need it to do any of those fabulous things! 

## Why No jQuery?

While jQuery was popular 5+ years ago, its influence is waning. Web app developers on the forefront of dev tech seem to be pushing away from it. jQuery is a very useful JS library, but it is not necessary, and it may cause conflicts with other JS components you wish to use.

jQuery is still found in many, many web applications, so learning a little bit about jQuery can be advantageous, and it is one more thing to put on your resume. We recommend checking out Codeup's jQuery module for a quick tour of its capabilities.
