# JS Events

An `event listener` is code that executes when an specific event occurs. It is the foundation of a type of programming known as `event-driven programming`.

In this section, we will cover how to use vanilla JavaScript to attach event listeners to HTML elements that will react to a variety of events, e.g., mouse clicking and pressing keys on the keyboard.

Note that `event listeners` are also referred to as `event handlers`.
