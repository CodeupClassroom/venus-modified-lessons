# Online Portfolio / Resume

For this project, you will be creating a personal website that can be shown to potential employers or recruiters.

## Site setup

We will set up our site to work with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which will let us host our
personal site for free!

1. Create a new project for your personal site.

1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`. This will be your landing page, that is, the page that people will see when they first navigate to your site.

1. Create a new git repository locally.

1. Create a new repository on Github that is named `your-username.github.io` and
   link up your local repository.
    - if you follow this naming convention precisely, whatever you have in this
      repository will be available at `https://your-username.github.io`.

## Specification

Keep in mind that the audience for your personal site is potential employers.

Your site should:

- Be mobile responsive
- Have your contact information clearly displayed
- Have links to your social media presence (if they are professional)
- Link to your GitHub
- Contain a portfolio of projects you've completed (you can update this
  throughout the course)
- Identify yourself as a job seeker
- Link to your resume

If your site contains all of the above, be creative! Your personal site is a
canvas for you to show off to the world!
