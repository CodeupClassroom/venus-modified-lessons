3. Create a repo (called "movies-person1-person2") under the organization
4. Create a new IntelliJ project (called "movies-person1-person2")
5. Connect the IntelliJ project to the GH repo
6. Copy/create the .gitignore file
7. Copy jalopy files into the new project
8. Confirm a baseline of functionality (e.g., Home and/or About pages are showing)
9. Add, commit, push

### B. Setup (the other teammate)
1. Create a new IntelliJ project (select New from VCS in IntelliJ)
2. Clone the project from your GH organization's repo


### How to use Git in this project
### IMPORTANT: DO NOT COMMIT YOUR WORK TO MAIN DIRECTLY IN THIS PROJECT!
1. Before starting work, create and checkout a branch for the work to do. E.g., add-movie
2. Work normally in your branch
3. Add, commit, and push your branch regularly
4. When done, submit a Pull Request for merging into main
